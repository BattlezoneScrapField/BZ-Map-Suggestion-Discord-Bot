# Random Battlezone Map Suggestion Bot
<img width="25%" src="./img/logo01.png">


## Features:
Choose maps by different query parameters like: `game=` `gamemode=` `bzn=` `mod=`


## Bucket Branches:
The branch, `buckets`, can be updated aside from the `master` branch, to allocate map file resources, without affecting the codebase. 
The Bot (when active) will pull the bucket(s) and the available map-info assets within. Eventually, mods can have their own bucket to be compatible with suggestions of playable maps available in Battlezone mods.
